Hi there, I don't know how you got here, but let me introduce myself weirdly. My name is **Tebogo Tema**. I am a `Junior Software Engineer` and a self-taught freelance `Graphic Designer`. My graphic design work ranges from *UI* and some little bit of *UX*, some merch clothing design, identity systems and a bit of everything in `Software engineering` side. 

I don't know what to touch in `Software Engineering` field, but for the past 2 years I've done a lot; and I can't say I have a specific field I am interested in, but I do almost everything. I enjoy both front end (not CSS lol) and a lot of backend coding.

Anyway, as I am starting my professional career in `Software Engineering` as an intern for a very big company, I have decided to create a **blog/ website** to document the whole thing; from the struggles and hardships I am going to face, the technologies I will be exposed to, learning methodologies, my obscure thoughts on certain topics and other infinite things.

It won't be limited to Software Engineering, I will cover a range of topics in different fields; creativity, photography, design, music, study methods, and maybe a bit of markerting.

So, if you will be occasionally reading my blogs, just don't take my words as final - I am really sure my thoughts and mindset will be super wrong. 

Anyway, these are my humble beginnings.
