I am a software automation engineer with a focus on designing, implementing, and maintaining automated solutions to optimize the software development process.

My expertise includes utilizing tools such as Jenkins for continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) and a keen interest in AWS and cloud-based infrastructure to create scalable and reliable software systems. 

Driven by a passion for efficiency and process improvement, I constantly explore innovative ways to automate tasks, contributing to reduced manual effort, accelerated delivery, and improved quality.

In my role, I closely collaborate with development, testing, and operations teams, ensuring timely delivery of high-quality software. I actively seek out new tools and techniques to enhance automation capabilities, taking pride in fostering a culture of automation within the organization.
