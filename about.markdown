My name is Tebogo Tema, a Software Engineer graduate from WeThinkCode_. I am into full stack development, DevOps, a bit of Software Architecture and Quality Assurance.

I have a unique ability to combine both logical and creative thinking to solve problems and produce effective systems.

As I am going up the Software journey, I am looking for opportunities
that will help and push me grow in any way possible.
