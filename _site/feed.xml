I always have a hobby I tend to monetize.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It all started with design. I started off creating cartoon illustrations of my friends; I considered it a fun activity. Then I went to charging R50 per cartoon because I need airtime to buy mobile data to access the internet everyday. I then found myself buying online courses on Udemy to learn how to design and use Adobe Illustrator efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From creating cartoons, I decided to go on a Graphic Design route and design logos for small businesses. And that was my start on monetizing a hobby; it later became a side hustle and then a job. I wasn’t doing it for fun or for my own amusement or to impress my friends. I was doing it to create some money on the side, crazy!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hobbies are meant to be fun and keep you away from work-related stuff, something that keeps you away from you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I know that I can basically turn any hobby into some sort of money-making medium. I want to start a hobby that wouldn’t allow me to do any of those; skateboarding. I have been looking at a lot of skateboarding videos on YouTube, and I swear that looks fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the lesson here is to avoid monetizing your hobbies. You will end up bored and consider the fun stuff “work”.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Tebogo Tema</name></author><category term="Hobbies" /><category term="Design" /><category term="Creative" /><summary type="html">I often find myself busy in most cases; whether I am designing, coding, reading something, researching, or watching YouTube - I am occupied almost every time.

My name is Tebogo Tema. I am a Junior Software Engineer and a self-taught freelance Graphic Designer. My graphic design work ranges from &lt;em&gt;UI&lt;/em&gt; and some little bit of &lt;em&gt;UX&lt;/em&gt;, some merch clothing design, identity systems and a bit of everything in Software engineering side.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t know what to touch in Sofware Engineering field, but for the past 2 years I’ve done a lot; and I can’t say I have a specific field I am interested in, but I do almost everything. I enjoy both front end (not CSS lol) and a lot of backend coding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, as I am starting my professional career in Sofware Engineering as an intern for a very big company, I have decided to create a blog/website to document the whole thing; from the struggles and hardships I am going to face, the technologies I will be exposed to, learning methodologies, my obscure thoughts on certain topics and other infinite things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It won’t be limited to Software Engineering, I will cover a range of topics in different fields; creativity, photography, design, music, study methods, and maybe a bit of markerting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, if you will be occasionally reading my blogs, just don’t take my words as final - I am really sure my thoughts and mindset will be super wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, these are my humble beginnings.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Tebogo Tema</name></author><category term="first post" /><category term="start" /><category term="beginning" /><summary type="html">Hi there, I don’t know how you got here, but let me introduce myself weirdly.
